In this installment I will discuss the neuron. This is a brain. Estimates vary but right now the best guess\nseems to be that our brains contain around 85 billion neurons. The neuron is a nerve cell and is the primary\nfunctional unit of the nervous system. This is a generic image of a neuron. Neurons actually come in all shapes and sizes\nbut this is the prototypical version of a neuron that you\u2019ll often see in a textbook. The structures extending from the left side\nof a neuron that look a little bit like tree branches are called dendrites. Dendrites are the area where neurons receive\nmost of their information. There are receptors on dendrites that are\ndesigned to pick up signals from other neurons that come in the form of chemicals called\nneurotransmitters. Those signals picked up by dendrites cause\nelectrical changes in a neuron that are interpreted in an area called the soma or the cell body. The soma contains the nucleus, which contains\nthe DNA or genetic material of the cell. The soma takes all the information from the\ndendrites and puts it together in an area called the axon hillock. If the signal coming from the dendrites is\nstrong enough then a signal is sent to the next part of the neuron, which is called the\naxon. At this point the signal is called an action\npotential. The action potential travels down the axon,\nwhich is covered with myelin, an insulatory material that helps to prevent the signal\nfrom degrading. The last step for the action potential is\nthe axon terminals, also known as synaptic buttons. When the signal reaches the axon terminals\nit can cause the release of neurotransmitter. These purple structures represent the dendrites\nof another neuron. When a neurotransmitter is released from axon\nterminals, it interacts with receptors on the dendrites of the next neuron, and then\nthe process repeats with the next neuron."}, "5p9ucgRDie8": {"video_id": "5p9ucgRDie8", "title": "10-Minute Neuroscience: Neurons", "transcript": "Hi everyone, welcome to 10 minute\u00a0\nneuroscience. In this installment,\u00a0\u00a0 I\u2019ll be talking about neurons, the fundamental\u00a0\nunits of the nervous system. I\u2019ll cover their\u00a0\u00a0 basic structure and function and then I\u2019ll\u00a0\ntalk about some ways we can categorize neurons. Neurons have some unique functions that form the\u00a0\nbasis for the powerful information processing\u00a0\u00a0 capabilities of the nervous system. They\u2019re\u00a0\nspecialized for transmitting and receiving\u00a0\u00a0 information, and they can communicate with one\u00a0\nanother as well as with cells in other types of\u00a0\u00a0 tissues (like muscles or glands). They can also\u00a0\ncarry information (such as sensory information)\u00a0\u00a0 from the rest of the body to the brain. Something\u00a0\nelse worth noting about neurons is that there are\u00a0\u00a0 a lot of them. Current estimates suggest there's\u00a0\nabout 86 billion neurons in a typical human brain,\u00a0\u00a0 and those neurons create a very complex circuitry\u00a0\nas each neuron forms many connections\u2014usually\u00a0\u00a0 thousands of connections\u2014with other neurons.\u00a0\nThis creates anywhere from hundreds of trillions\u00a0\u00a0 to maybe more than a quadrillion areas in a human\u00a0\nbrain where neurons communicate with one another. So if you look at a neuroscience textbook,\u00a0\nyou\u2019ll see an image of a neuron that looks\u00a0\u00a0 something like this, and this is what we\u2019ll\u00a0\nuse for our discussion of the neuron today.\u00a0\u00a0 But it\u2019s important to note that neurons\u00a0\ncome in all shapes and sizes\u2014there are\u00a0\u00a0 over 1000 different types\u2014and most of them\u00a0\ndon\u2019t look just like this one\u2013so you can\u00a0\u00a0 see here some examples of different types of\u00a0\nneurons found throughout the nervous system.\u00a0\u00a0 They look quite different, but they're all\u00a0\nvariations on a theme, and most of them have\u00a0\u00a0 the same general components\u2014those general\u00a0\ncomponents are what we\u2019ll focus on today. Before we get into those components let me just\u00a0\nsay something about how neurons communicate,\u00a0\u00a0 because it will make the anatomy we\u2019ll talk about\u00a0\nnext easier to understand. I\u2019ll have other videos\u00a0\u00a0 that cover these topics more in-depth but\u00a0\nI\u2019ll just provide a quick summary here.\u00a0\u00a0 Most neurons use electrical and chemical\u00a0\nsignals to send messages throughout the\u00a0\u00a0 brain. The main type of electrical signals are\u00a0\ncalled action potentials; they\u2019re created when\u00a0\u00a0 charged particles called ions flow into neurons\u00a0\nand generate an electrical impulse that can travel\u00a0\u00a0 from one end of a neuron to another. These\u00a0\naction potentials can cause the release of\u00a0\u00a0 chemical signals called neurotransmitters,\u00a0\nand neurotransmitters can travel from one\u00a0\u00a0 neuron to the next neuron and either generate a\u00a0\nresponse or inhibit a response in the next neuron.\u00a0\u00a0 By relying on these mechanisms, neurons\u00a0\ncan spread signals throughout the brain\u00a0\u00a0 in a fraction of a second. (I should point\u00a0\nout that there are neurons that don\u2019t use\u00a0\u00a0 neurotransmitters and rely solely on electrical\u00a0\nsignals to communicate with one another,\u00a0\u00a0 but we won\u2019t focus on them here because they\u2019re\u00a0\nrelatively rare in the adult nervous system.) OK, so let\u2019s talk a bit about these different\u00a0\nparts of a neuron. So first, on the right side\u00a0\u00a0 of this cell you can see a number of branch-like\u00a0\nextensions jutting out from a circular structure\u00a0\u00a0 that otherwise resembles a typical cell. These\u00a0\nextensions are called dendrites. The word dendrite\u00a0\u00a0 comes from a Greek word that means tree-like, and\u00a0\nthe name fits because dendrites bear a resemblance\u00a0\u00a0 to tree branches. Dendrites are the part of the\u00a0\nneuron that typically receives messages from\u00a0\u00a0 other neurons. To accomplish this, on the surface\u00a0\nof dendrites are proteins called receptors that\u00a0\u00a0 neurotransmitters can interact with. Because\u00a0\ndendrites are typically where information\u00a0\u00a0 in a neuron is received, they can generally\u00a0\nbe thought of as an input area for the neuron. The part of the neuron that most resembles a\u00a0\ntypical cell is called the cell body or soma\u00a0\u00a0 (and soma is another Greek word that means body).\u00a0\nThe cell body is the metabolic center of the cell.\u00a0\u00a0 It contains the nucleus (which contains the DNA),\u00a0\nit contains organelles that are involved in doing\u00a0\u00a0 things like making proteins, and it\u2019s the site of\u00a0\nthe synthesis of various other neural components. Sticking out from one side of the\u00a0\ncell body you can see this little\u00a0\u00a0 hill-like area, that\u2019s called the axon hillock.\u00a0\u00a0 When information is received at the dendrites,\u00a0\nit causes changes in the electrical properties\u00a0\u00a0 of the cell, and the axon hillock is a\u00a0\nregion where those changes are integrated\u00a0\u00a0 to determine if the incoming signals are\u00a0\nstrong enough for the neuron to initiate\u00a0\u00a0 its own action potential. This process of\u00a0\nintegrating signals is called summation. If a neuron fires an action potential, the impulse\u00a0\nwill travel down this structure called the axon\u00a0\u00a0 at very rapid speeds ranging from 1 to 100 m/s.\u00a0\nSo axons act to conduct action potentials. They\u00a0\u00a0 vary in size and can range from the order\u00a0\nof micrometers, or millionths of a meter,\u00a0\u00a0 to up to about a meter in humans for the axons\u00a0\nthat run from the spinal cord to the foot.\u00a0\u00a0 Because there are so many neurons in the brain,\u00a0\nby some estimates if you took all the neurons out\u00a0\u00a0 of the brain and laid them end to end, the axons\u00a0\nwould stretch over 100,000 miles\u2014that\u2019s enough\u00a0\u00a0 to wrap around the globe about 4 times. Axons\u00a0\nare usually (although not always) covered in\u00a0\u00a0 a lipid-rich insulatory material called myelin\u00a0\n(and that's what this purple striped structure\u00a0\u00a0 is representing here). Myelin helps to speed up\u00a0\nthe propagation of electrical signals down the\u00a0\u00a0 axon. It prevents the current from leaking out\u00a0\nof the axon, but also it has these gaps in the\u00a0\u00a0 myelin called nodes of Ranvier---that's what\u00a0\nthis little area is here, a node of Ranvier.\u00a0\u00a0 And Ranvier is just the name of the\u00a0\nscientist who discovered these).\u00a0\u00a0 At these gaps are channels that allow positively\u00a0\ncharged sodium ions to flow into the neuron. This\u00a0\u00a0 influx of positively-charged ions helps\u00a0\nto regenerate the action potential and\u00a0\u00a0 move it down the axon (this is something else\u00a0\nthat I\u2019ll talk about more in another video). At the end of the axon, you see that the structure\u00a0\nbranches out into endings we call axon terminals\u00a0\u00a0 or synaptic boutons.\u00a0\u00a0 The word bouton is French for button.\u00a0\u00a0 The axon terminals are often situated very close\u00a0\nto the dendrites of another neuron (although they\u00a0\u00a0 can be situated next to any component of\u00a0\nother neurons), and they communicate with\u00a0\u00a0 other neurons at specialized regions called\u00a0\nsynapses. So this right here is a synapse.\u00a0\u00a0 The neurons that communicate at a synapse don't\u00a0\ntypically come into contact with one another,\u00a0\u00a0 but the space separating them is very small:\u00a0\noften only about 20-40 nanometers wide. I\u00a0\u00a0 know a nanometer is not something we can\u00a0\neasily conceptualize, but for comparison,\u00a0\u00a0 a human hair is about 80,000-100,000 nanometers\u00a0\nwide. So the space between neurons is very, very,\u00a0\u00a0 very tiny. That space is called a synaptic\u00a0\ncleft. The neuron whose axon terminals end\u00a0\u00a0 at the synaptic cleft is called the presynaptic\u00a0\nneuron (and that would be this black neuron here),\u00a0\u00a0 while the neuron on the other side of the synaptic\u00a0\ncleft is called the postsynaptic neuron (that\u00a0\u00a0 would be this blue neuron here). When an action\u00a0\npotential reaches the axon terminal it can cause\u00a0\u00a0 chemicals called neurotransmitters to be released\u00a0\ninto that synaptic cleft. The neurotransmitters\u00a0\u00a0 can then bind or attach to receptors on the\u00a0\npostsynaptic neuron, and either increase or\u00a0\u00a0 decrease the likelihood that the postsynaptic\u00a0\nneuron will fire an action potential of its own. So those are the basic components of a neuron.\u00a0\nAgain most neurons have those defined regions but\u00a0\u00a0 they still often differ from one another in other\u00a0\nsubstantial ways. We can use those differences to\u00a0\u00a0 group neurons into some broad categories. One way\u00a0\nof categorizing neurons is based on the number of\u00a0\u00a0 processes that extend from the cell body. Using\u00a0\nthis method of classification, there are three\u00a0\u00a0 main groups of neurons: multipolar, bipolar, and\u00a0\nunipolar. Multipolar neurons are the most common\u00a0\u00a0 type of neuron in the human nervous system and the\u00a0\nnervous systems of other vertebrates. Multipolar\u00a0\u00a0 neurons usually have a single axon and many\u00a0\ndendrites. They come in various shapes and sizes.\u00a0\u00a0 The length of their axons varies as does the\u00a0\nextent of their dendritic branching, so they can\u00a0\u00a0 still look very different from one another, but\u00a0\nall of them are modifications on a similar plan. Bipolar neurons have a cell body that gives\u00a0\nrise to two extensions: one axon and one\u00a0\u00a0 dendritic structure. Sensory systems, like the\u00a0\nvisual system, rely heavily on bipolar neurons. Unipolar neurons have a single extension\u00a0\nthat has multiple branches, one of which\u00a0\u00a0 acts as the axon and others that form dendrites.\u00a0\nUnipolar neurons are the simplest type of neuron,\u00a0\u00a0 and are common in invertebrate nervous systems but\u00a0\nnot very common in humans and other vertebrates. There are also variants of bipolar neurons\u00a0\ncalled pseudo-unipolar neurons. These cells\u00a0\u00a0 initially form as bipolar neurons, but\u00a0\nthe dendrite and the axon fuse together\u00a0\u00a0 to form a single process that extends from\u00a0\npart of the cell body. Pseudo-unipolar\u00a0\u00a0 neurons carry sensory signals, such as\u00a0\ninformation about touch to the spinal cord. Neurons can also be classified based on\u00a0\nfunction. Motor neurons, for example,\u00a0\u00a0 are responsible for controlling movement. So they\u00a0\nhave axons that form synapses with muscles to\u00a0\u00a0 cause those muscles to contract. Sensory neurons\u00a0\ncarry sensory signals back to the spinal cord\u00a0\u00a0 and brain. This would include information,\u00a0\nfor example, about touch, smell, vision,\u00a0\u00a0 etc. But the vast majority of neurons in the\u00a0\nnervous system are considered interneurons,\u00a0\u00a0 which are neurons that receive information from\u00a0\nneurons and then pass it on to other neurons. So\u00a0\u00a0 they act as the intermediaries for neurons.\u00a0\nThese interneurons are also often subdivided\u00a0\u00a0 into two types: projection or relay interneurons\u00a0\nand local interneurons. Projection interneurons\u00a0\u00a0 typically have long axons that carry signals\u00a0\nover long distances, such as from one part of\u00a0\u00a0 the brain to another. Local interneurons, on\u00a0\nthe other hand, form connections with other\u00a0\u00a0 neurons nearby. So, they have short axons\u00a0\nand are involved in creating local circuits. So that is your basic summary\u00a0\nof neurons. Thanks for watching!"}}
