Now, the Osnabr\u00fcck-native, superstar DJ and producer is set to release his highly-anticipated follow-up longplayer: Almost exactly one year after the release of his globally acclaimed breakthrough debut, Schulz is back on track with yet another stroke of genius: Promisingly entitled \u201cSUGAR\u201d, album no. 2 will be released later this year on September 18th!\n\nEarlier this July, Schulz was awarded Triple Gold for his tremendous hit single \u201cPrayer in C\u201d, Platinum for \u201cSun Goes Down (feat. Jasmine Thompson)\u201d as well as Gold for his debut album \u201cPrayer\u201d in his home territory \u2013 just 3 on a list of over 60(!) awards already amassed by the German deep house shooting star. In light of his upcoming new longplayer \u201cSUGAR\u201d, Robin Schulz is now about to take the next step in his amazingly successful career:\n\nAfter his airplay #1 and global smash single \u201cHeadlights\u201d (feat. Ilsey) which delivered the first taste of his new album\u2019s sound, the twentysomething is set to release the eponymous second single on July 17th: \u201cSugar\u201d, featuring 19-year-old Canadian singer Francesco Yates. Yates is widely considered the next big popstar in the making and his soulful falsetto vocals are quickly gaining praise by superstars such as Pharrell Williams or Justin Bieber. \n\nThat being said, Schulz is more than likely to build on his peerless, record-breaking achievements of the past 18 months: Last year\u2019s mega hit \u201cPrayer in C\u201d landed Robin Schulz the #1 spot on iTunes in 40 countries and topped the national singles charts in 17 countries, but that was just the beginning. His #1 remix of \u201cWaves\u201d earned him a Grammy nomination, while his Top 7 album \u201cPrayer\u201d received the German ECHO award for best \u201cDance National\u201d, in addition to a completely sold-out US tour. \n\nToday, Schulz remains the first German artist to attain the #1 spot in the global Shazam charts. He runs the most successful German YouTube music channel with a combined 330 million views, while generating downloads and streams in excess of nine figures. \n\nOn the heels of his recent tour of the U.S., Canada, South Africa and Australia, Robin Schulz will be headlining major electro & dance festivals all over the world throughout the summer, such as Belgium\u2019s Tomorrowland Festival.\n\nhttp://www.warnermusic.de\nhttp://www.youtube.com/warnermusicDE", "thumbnail": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bvC_0foemLY/mqdefault.jpg", "position": 117}, {"video_id": "-2U0Ivkn2Ds", "title": "A Great Big World, Christina Aguilera - Say Something", "description": "Watch the official music video for \"Say Somthing\" by A Great Big World \nListen to A Great Big World: https://AGreatBigWorld.lnk.to/listenYD\n\nSubscribe to A Great Big World official YouTube channel: https://AGreatBigWorld.lnk.to/subscribeYD\n\nWatch more A Great Big World videos: https://AGreatBigWorld.lnk.to/listenYC/youtube\n\nFollow A Great Big World:\nFacebook: https://AGreatBigWorld.lnk.to/followFI\nInstagram: https://AGreatBigWorld.lnk.to/followII\nTwitter: https://AGreatBigWorld.lnk.to/followTI\nSpotify: https://AGreatBigWorld.lnk.to/followSI\nWebsite: https://AGreatBigWorld.lnk.to/followWI\nYouTube: https://AGreatBigWorld.lnk.to/subscribeYD\n\nChorus:\nSay something, I'm giving up on you\nI'll be the one, if you want me to\nAnywhere, I would've followed you\nSay something, I'm giving up on you\n\n#AGreatBigWorld #SaySomething #OfficialMusicVideo", "thumbnail": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-2U0Ivkn2Ds/mqdefault.jpg", "position": 118}, {"video_id": "47dtFZ8CFo8", "title": "Capital Cities - Safe And Sound", "description": "\"Safe and Sound\" available on Capital Cities' debut album 'In A Tidal Wave of Mystery,' download on iTunes \nhttp://smarturl.it/IATWOM\n\nCapital Cities take you through the history of dance in their official music video for \"Safe and Sound\" \n\nFollow Capital Cities:\nhttp://capitalcitiesmusic.com\nhttp://twitter.com/capitalcities\nhttp://facebook.com/capitalcities\nhttp://instagram.com/capitalcities\nhttp://youtube.com/capitalcitiesmusic\n\nMusic video by Capital Cities performing Safe And Sound.

Give Life Back to Music\n2. Get Lucky\n3. Lose Yourself to Dance\n\n\"Daft Punk is an electronic music duo consisting of French musicians Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo (born 8 February 1974) and Thomas Bangalter (born 3 January 1975). Daft Punk reached significant popularity in the late 1990s house movement in France and met with continued success in the years following, combining elements of house with synthpop. The duo is credited with producing songs that are considered essential in the French house scene. The group was managed from 1996 to 2008 by Pedro Winter (Busy P), the head of Ed Banger Records. Early in the group's career, the band members were strongly influenced by groups such as The Beach Boys and The Rolling Stones.\"", "thumbnail": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/itPtz6Bar_8/mqdefault.jpg", "position": 213}, {"video_id": "wwwQ4uVGGSE", "title": "Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross - A Minute To Breathe", "description": "From the upcoming film 'Before the Flood,' airing globally in 171 countries and 45 languages on the National Geographic Channel starting October 30.\nListen to song on Apple Music \u2013 http://smarturl.it/amtbam\n\nThe full soundtrack will be out via Apple Music on October 21 and is a collaboration between Trent & Atticus, Gustavo Santaolalla and Mogwai\n\nPreorder album on iTunes - http://smarturl.it/amtbi\nPreorder vinyl on NIN.com - http://smarturl.it/amtbd2c\n\nDirected by John Crawford and Reuben Wu\nCinematography by Reuben Wu \nAdditional footage: 'Before The Flood' / National Geographic", "thumbnail": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wwwQ4uVGGSE/mqdefault.jpg", "position": 214}, {"video_id": "pok8H_KF1FA", "title": "Doja Cat - Say So (Official Video)", "description": "Official Video for \u201cSay So\u201d by Doja Cat \nListen to Doja Cat: https://DojaCat.lnk.to/listenYD \n\nSubscribe to the official Doja Cat YouTube channel: https://DojaCat.lnk.to/subscribeYD \n\nDirector: Hannah Lux Davis @hannahluxdavis\nExecutive Producer: Brandon Bonfiglio @bbonfiglio\nCommissioner: Sam Houston @samhoustonishere\nChoreographer: Cortland Brown @fulloutcortland\nProduction Company: London Alley @londonalley\nCameos: @donte.colley and @yodelinghaley\n\nFollow Doja Cat \nFacebook: https://DojaCat.lnk.to/followFI \nInstagram: https://DojaCat.lnk.to/followII \nTwitter: https://DojaCat.lnk.to/followTI \nWebsite: https://DojaCat.lnk.to/followWI \nSpotify: https://DojaCat.lnk.to/followSI \nYouTube: https://DojaCat.lnk.to/followYD \nTikTok: https://DojaCat.lnk.to/followYx \n\nAsk your voice device to play Doja Cat! \n\nLyrics:\nDay to night to morning, keep with me in the moment\nI'd let you had I\u2005known\u2005it, why don't\u2005you say so?\nDidn't even notice, no\u2005punches left to roll with\nYou got to keep me focused; you want it?
